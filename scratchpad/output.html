<p>With this reverse convertible, at maturity, the investor will receive either the nominal amount or in the event of negative price performance by the shares, a fixed number of shares determined at the time the product is issued. Regardless of the price performance, the investor will receive above-average interest, the amount of which is determined by the interest rate.</p>

<ol>
	<li>At maturity, if the reference price is equal or greater than the base price, the investor will receive the nominal amount.</li>
	<li>If the reference price is below the base price, the investor will receive a predetermined number of shares defined by the multiplier. Fractional amounts of shares will not be delivered. Instead, a cash amount in EUR will be paid per reverse convertible.</li>
</ol>

<p>During the term of the security, the investor will receive no current income from dividends.</p>

<h3 class="optional">Investment objectives and strategy / Market expectations</h3>

<p>The reverse convertible is intended for investors who believe that the share price will move sideways or rise only moderately.</p>

<h2>What are the risks and what could I get in return?</h2>

<h3>Risks at maturity</h3>

<p>If the share is quoted below the base price of the reverse convertible on the valuation date, shares will be delivered, the value of which may be considerably lower than the nominal amount of the reverse convertible. In this case, the investor must be aware that he may sustain losses even after the valuation date until the shares are transferred into his account. If the loss is not offset by the amount of interest, the investor will suffer a loss. Worst case: apart from the interest payment, the invested capital may be worthless upon delivery.</p>

<h3>Market risk during the term of the security</h3>

<p>The value of the reverse convertible during the term of the security can be adversely affected, in particular by the factors determining the market price listed in section 4, and the value of the reverse convertible may be considerably below the purchase price.</p>

<h3>Credit risk / Issuer risk</h3>

<p>Investors are exposed to the risk of insolvency and thus a default by the issuer. Information regarding the relevant issuer rating is available at <a href="http://www.examplesite.com/">www.examplesite.com</a>. The reverse convertible is subject to no deposit guarantee as a bearer bond.</p>

<h2>What are the risks and what could I get in return?</h2>

<h3>Marketability</h3>

<p>After the issue date, the reverse convertible can generally be bought or sold on or off-exchange. The issuer will provide continuous indicative buy and sell prices for the reverse convertible under normal market conditions (market making), though with no legal obligation to do so. In extraordinary market conditions or in the event of technical failure, the purchase or sale of the reverse convertible may be temporarily impeded or made impossible.</p>

<h3>Factors determining the market price during the term of the security</h3>

<p>During the term of the security, the value of the reverse convertible can be considerably below the purchase price. The market price of the reverse convertible depends primarily on the performance of the share, although without tracking the share&#39;s performance on a 1-to-1 basis. If the reverse convertible is purchased during the term of the security, accrued interest must be paid in addition to the purchase price. In particular, the following conditions may also affect the market price of the reverse convertible:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Change in the intensity of price fluctuations of the share (volatility)</li>
	<li>General changes in interest rates</li>
	<li>Payment of dividends</li>
	<li>Remaining term of the reverse convertible</li>
</ul>

<p>Various individual market factors may offset or reinforce each other.</p>

<h2>Costs / Distribution costs</h2>

<p>The initial issue price of the reverse convertible and the bid and ask prices quoted by the issuer during the term of the security are based on the internal pricing models of the issuer. In particular, a margin may be included in these prices to cover the costs for structuring the security, the issuer&rsquo;s risk hedging costs and distribution costs (reimbursement / contribution) where applicable.</p>

<h3>Purchase and disposal costs</h3>

<p>If a fixed or determinable price (fixed price transaction) is agreed, purchase, and as the case may be, disposal fees and expenses for the sale of the reverse convertible, including third party fees, will not be invoiced separately; these are included in the agreed upon price. Otherwise (commission business), fees for the purchase or disposal of the reverse convertible in the amount agreed with the bank and other potential fees and expenses will be incurred separately (d.g. stock exchange fees).</p>

<p>Subscription fee: none</p>

<h3>Ongoing costs</h3>

<p>Investors also must pay deposit costs in the amount agreed with the bank.</p>

<h3>Reimbursement / Contribution</h3>

<p>Placement fee: up to 1.00% of the initial issue price.</p>

<p>Commission fee: none</p>

<h3>Taxation</h3>

<p>Investors should consult a tax advisor to discuss the individual tax implications of the purchase, ownership and disposal or redemption of the reverse convertible.</p>
