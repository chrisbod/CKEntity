        <strong>1. What is this Product? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Product type </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Reverse convertible (Bearer debt security)
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>General description of the product</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        With this reverse convertible, at maturity, the investor will receive either the nominal amount or in the event of negative price performance by the
        shares, a fixed number of shares determined at the time the product is issued. Regardless of the price performance, the investor will receive
        above-average interest, the amount of which is determined by the interest rate.
    </p>
    <p>
        a) At maturity, if the reference price is equal or greater than the base price, the investor will receive the nominal amount.
    </p>
    <p>
        b) If the reference price is below the base price, the investor will receive a predetermined number of shares defined by the multiplier. Fractional
        amounts of shares will not be delivered. Instead, a cash amount in EUR will be paid per reverse convertible.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the term of the security, the investor will receive no current income from dividends.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Investment objectives and strategy / Market expectations </strong>
        <strong>(optional) </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The reverse convertible is intended for investors who believe that the share price will move sideways or rise only moderately.

        <strong>3. What are the risks and what could I get in return?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Risks at maturity</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If the share is quoted below the base price of the reverse convertible on the valuation date, shares will be delivered, the value of which may be
        considerably lower than the nominal amount of the reverse convertible. In this case, the investor must be aware that he may sustain losses even after
        the valuation date until the shares are transferred into his account. If the loss is not offset by the amount of interest, the investor will suffer a
        loss. Worst case: apart from the interest payment, the invested capital may be worthless upon delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Market risk during the term of the security</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The value of the reverse convertible during the term of the security can be adversely affected, in particular by the factors determining the market
        price listed in section 4, and the value of the reverse convertible may be considerably below the purchase price.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Credit risk / Issuer risk </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
Investors are exposed to the risk of insolvency and thus a default by the issuer. Information regarding the relevant issuer rating is available at        <a href="http://www.examplesite.com/">www.examplesite.com</a>. The reverse convertible is subject to no deposit guarantee as a bearer bond.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>4. Availability</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Marketability</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        After the issue date, the reverse convertible can generally be bought or sold on or off-exchange. The issuer will provide continuous indicative buy and
        sell prices for the reverse convertible under normal market conditions (market making), though with no legal obligation to do so. In extraordinary
        market conditions or in the event of technical failure, the purchase or sale of the reverse convertible may be temporarily impeded or made impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Factors determining the market price during the term of the security</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        During the term of the security, the value of the reverse convertible can be considerably below the purchase price. The market price of the reverse
        convertible depends primarily on the performance of the share, although without tracking the share's performance on a 1-to-1 basis. If the reverse
        convertible is purchased during the term of the security, accrued interest must be paid in addition to the purchase price. In particular, the following
        conditions may also affect the market price of the reverse convertible:
    </p>
    <p>
        o Change in the intensity of price fluctuations of the share (volatility)
    </p>
    <p>
        o General changes in interest rates
    </p>
    <p>
        o Payment of dividends
    </p>
    <p>
        o Remaining term of the reverse convertible
    </p>
    <p>
        Various individual market factors may offset or reinforce each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>5. Opportunities and performance scenario analysis</strong>

        The following examples apply at maturity. They provide no indication on the actual performance of the reverse convertible.

        Upon purchase of the initial issue price:
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>For the investor positive performance</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>For the investor negative performance</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>6. Costs / Distribution costs </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The initial issue price of the reverse convertible and the bid and ask prices quoted by the issuer during the term of the security are based on the
        internal pricing models of the issuer. In particular, a margin may be included in these prices to cover the costs for structuring the security, the
        issuer’s risk hedging costs and distribution costs (reimbursement / contribution) where applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Purchase and disposal costs</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If a fixed or determinable price (fixed price transaction) is agreed, purchase, and as the case may be, disposal fees and expenses for the sale of the
        reverse convertible, including third party fees, will not be invoiced separately; these are included in the agreed upon price. Otherwise (commission
        business), fees for the purchase or disposal of the reverse convertible in the amount agreed with the bank and other potential fees and expenses will
        be incurred separately (d.g. stock exchange fees).
    </p>
    <p>
        Subscription fee: none
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Ongoing costs</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Investors also must pay deposit costs in the amount agreed with the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Reimbursement / Contribution </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Placement fee: up to 1.00% of the initial issue price.
    </p>
    <p>
        Commission fee: none
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>7. Taxation</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Investors should consult a tax advisor to discuss the individual tax implications of the purchase, ownership and disposal or redemption of the reverse
        convertible.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>8. Other Disclosures </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The product information contained in this product information sheet does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell the reverse convertible and
        cannot replace individual consultation with the bank or with the investor’s advisor. This product information sheet does not include all of the
        relevant information for the reverse convertible. For complete information, particularly on the structure of the investment in the reverse convertible
        and the risks involved, potential investors should read the prospectus, which is available together with the Final Terms and any supplements at the XY
        Bank or can be downloaded free of charge at www.xybank.de.
